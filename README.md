Hello this is the official packnite project being develop from vscode and not from mcreator

Update 1.19.4 (development Progress, Release Soon on ModRinth and CurseForge.)

about 1.19.3/1.19.2 
Im thinking about Working on these versions of the mod. 

CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/packnite
ModRinth: (Soon)

if your looking for Forge Version then here -> https://github.com/ModxStudios/Packnite_Mod_Forge_1.19.4

info

Packnite is a stronger and yet better version of netherite, there is more to minecraft then just having netherite, it can't be broken with anything lower then a netherite pick, so even if you found it between y 10 or y -58. you still can't break it which makes it a good challenge for players as it would take a while to break the ore. Also if you do break the ore then there will be no drops for diamond and below, you would need a Netherite Pickaxe. (Might also be the fact that i need to lower the damage on the sword and i don't want it to be too OP)
